I did my first investment 2 years ago. It was a failure from my personal finances point of view. I invested €14 000 of my own money and I could not recover €13 200 from it. It was a success from raising equity-free funding and in being an employer.


#### Raising money

I am happy with the progress in raising money that I and my team achieved in these 2 years.

We received a grant of €50 000 from [ESA BIC Portugal](https://space.ipn.pt/) (the European Space Agency business incubator) in the first year.

We raised €150 000 from [Fit4Start](https://www.startupluxembourg.com/fit-4-start) in Luxembourg in the second year.

In total, we raised €200 000. This was good pre-seed money we managed to raise and we exchanged no equity for it. 

A founder's conflict developed in the meantime (read more about it [here](http://katstam.com/how-i-walked_away-from-eur-152500/) if you are interested). Because of it the best desicion for us to take to protect the money of our investors was never to request €152 500.

This is what we did with the €37 500 we did receive.


#### Creting Jobs

We created 4 high-qualified personnel jobs with the money we have received and I am proud of it.

We paid €24 455 in salaries, €1 965,6 in social security, €2 745 in IRS and €3 600 in company taxes.


#### Personal money

Every investment is a risk taken. Some investments are also risky - as building a startup is. This is exactly what I did - and I could not recover the money I had invested in my startup. My loss was €13 200 and that's okay. Some investments multiply the money invested and some lose it.
