Here are the things I quickly covered in the 15-minte slot I had at the opening event of FemGems in October 2020.



**How did you get into entrepreneurship** 

I am born to be an entrepreneur. It is the only occupation that quiets the voice in my head shouting *You can do better!*. My advice to you - find that thing that quiets your voice.

In pratical terms, when I was little and my paretns asked me *Who do you want to be when you gro up*, I said - *I want to be a businesswoman*. Then, when at Uni, I took 1 entrepreneurship course during my final year of my bachelor degree. Honestly speaking, I needed the credits - and the schedule of this course fit my schedule perfectly. But that course ended up being the push that gave me the confidence, and some of the knowledge, I needed to start my own business. 

Fast forward 8 years in the future, after a master degree and a couple of corporate jobs, I was not feeling happy. I changed countries and decided I will start a *women in tech* meetup. I did not start a *women in tech* meetup. I was invited to join the organizers of another meetup which was about to start - a *data science* meetup. This was great as I was not a solo organizer, which helps a lot, and I thought and still think that data science is much more exciting than tech in general. So I ended up starting a meetup - just a slightly differen one. Then I founded my first startup - it failed. Then I started my consulting agency and after it - I founded my second startup. 

What I am most excited about is that with every new project in my life, I learn how to dream bigger and bigger. Now I am curious to see how high I can go :)



**What barriers have you overcome**

Oh, many ... and I am sure that I have faced only the tip of the iceberg of what lies ahead. Oh boy...

- It is difficult to rise money as a first-time founder
- it is difficult to say no to self-sabotage and imposter syndom
- I chose my former co-founders wrong
- I learned from painful experience - instead of listening more to the founders who have done it before
- I faced sexism in business
- I needed to get the hang of accounting & legal
- I have felt stress and at some point it seemed that the work never finishes (which it does and that's okay)


**What have you learned from your journey that you want to share with aspiring entrepreneurs**

- ALWAYS, ALWAYS make sure everything is great from a legal perspective - all the deals, contracts, partnerships must be agreed upon in writing before starting
- being an entrepreneur is hard - it is one of the most challenging jobs we can have as human beings. Do it when it brings you more joy than stress and sadness.
- <3 ask for help all the time - you will be surprised how many people on all kinds of walks in life and business come to your aid when you need them. I was certainly pleasantly surprised.
- <3 do not listen to how other people describe you. Listen to how you describe yourself and believe that this description is true. 
- as soon as you opne your mouth to say something, people will be ready to jump and criticise you. That's okay
- leadership is hard. don't set up impossible goals for yourself - but rather get there step by step.
- <3 don't be afraid to show vulnerability in front of your employees. They deserve your truth.



**Why are you mentoring at femgems club**

I have passed through a very difficult time for my startup last year. If you are curious what happened exactly, read my 4-series blog posts about this story [here](http://katstam.com/how-i-walked_away-from-eur-152500/). 

At some point, the weight of the problem became so unbearable for me that I had to ask for help. And help was offered - in a kind, empathic and productive way. I am so grateful to the amazing individuals who were next to me during the difficult times I had to face with my startup. I want to pass this forward - and offer this kind of support to other at the time of their need. 

Curiosuly as I reach out to more and more people, more people reach out to me. More people listen to me and hear about my challenges - and some deepen the connection by offerings ideas and solutions. Thank you :)

At the end, helping others also seems to be helpign me - which is a nice unexpected bonus.
