## Be Bold

We can be first-time startup founder, or more experienced founders. Sometimes, usually comes with experience, we know the market we are market creators - think of the two cliches Airbnb (created the market of renting out your home) and Uber(created the market of renting out your car).

When you feel confident in your business and you know that this is going to work and make everyone a lot of money - be bold instead of being shy about it. I like this example of Carto's deck which helped them raise $23M of funding ⬇

Carto go one step further and document their process in this [blog post](https://medium.com/@carto/raising-money-in-the-current-environment-every-little-helps-2e345d103293#.5jvccxi7o) so I and you can read it, learn from their experience and do better in business. Thank you, Carto ♥.
