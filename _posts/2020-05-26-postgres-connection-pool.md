I was browsing Upwork today and a the job posting of someone who was hiring for a developer to run a python script automatically every hour and store some output generated by the script in a Postgres database. This means that they were looking to a. a way to automate the task execution and b. a way to ensure its continuous execution on a server in case of unexpected problems. 

This made me think of one of my former jobs some 5 years ago when we always needed to work on `screen`s under Ubuntu. This inspired me to make a quick experiment. I would write a script to print `This job is run every 10 seconds.` as output every 10 seconds and run this under `screen`.

### Why GNU Screen



### Take away

`Screen` is an awesome tool that you should start using right away when you run anything from a terminal. Screen helps your long-running task to continue running even in the event that your laptop dies, you close your terminal window by accident, your SSH connection to a remote server suddenly drops and anything else which might kill your task.
