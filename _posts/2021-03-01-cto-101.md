In the early days of a startup every cent counts. Here is how to stretch the money while using reliable tools and services 

## Code Repository


**tldr;** 👉 Self-hosted Gitlab on Digital Ocean 


**Option 1: Self-hosted Gitlab**

✔️ pros: great interface, CI/CD, revision control, project management

✖️ cons: it might cost more than normal Gitlab, depending on the hosting service

💵 The service itself - Free (There is an option to pay **$229** per user - billed annually)

💵 HOSTING 
- Google Cloud - **$918,12**  ($76.51 per month for a N2 high-memory type of a virtual machine). ⬅ **I am currently here**
- AWS - **$497,9** p.a. (or around €413,77). It requires production AWS RDS ($459 per year) & AWS EC2 ($38.90 per year) - minimal infrastructure
- Digital Ocean - $240 p.a . $20 a month with the minimum requirements + one-click installation (link [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d58840562553&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=CopyPaste))



**Option 2: Gitlab**


✔️ pros: great interface, CI/CD, revision control, project management

✖️ cons: more expensive than the self-hosted Gitlab after a certain number of users (rarely happens in early-stage startups)

💵 $4 per user per month for teams (see pricing details [here](https://github.com/pricing#feature-comparison))




**Option 3: Github**

✔️ pros: great interface, CI/CD, revision control, project management

✖️ cons: same as Gitlab

💵 $4 per user per month for teams (see pricing details [here](https://github.com/pricing#feature-comparison))

## Email


**tldr;** 👉 Zoho Mail 


**Option 1: Gsuite**

✔️ pros: great interface people are used to 

✖️ cons: pricey

💵 The service itself - $6 (around €4.98) per user per month 



**Option 2: Zoho Mail**

✔️ pros: great email interface; works well as email

✖️ cons: Zoho Docs are not as great to use as Google Docs; Calendarly invites do not get reflected in the calendar - to add manyally

💵 The service itself - **€0.9** per user per month

## Password Management


**tldr;** 👉 Last Pass 


**Option 1: [Keeper Security](https://www.keepersecurity.com/)**

✔️ pros: rated very secure; easy to add new entries to 

✖️ cons: the individual edition is affordable; it is pricey to have more than 1 user

💵 **$45**(or around €37,49) per user per year - see pricing [here](https://www.keepersecurity.com/pricing.html?t=b). My suggestion is to have 2 users - *admin* and *normal* which costs $90 a year



**Option 2: [Last Pass](https://www.lastpass.com/)**

✔️ pros: offline mode; now €3 cheaper than Keeper Security off the annual bundle

✖️ cons: I have not used it yet

💵 **€34.8** per month per user with their newest [pricing plan](https://www.lastpass.com/pricing) called MFA. My suggestion is to have 2 users - *admin* and *normal* which costs €69,6 a year

**Option 1: [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)**

💵 starting at **$5** per month per landing page (for a simple & small Wordpress website)



**Option 2: [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** 


✔️ pros: custom domains; secure connection; can be set up in 1 day or so

✖️ cons: Jekyll templates only

💵 free
