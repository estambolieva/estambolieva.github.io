Here is my most recent tutoring experience:
- teaching `programming and A.I.` to lawyers (the biggest Portuguese law firm) - and I got them successfully writing code in 5 weeks, and understanding the bits and bolts of simple machine learning algorithms by week 8
- `recommended system workshop` at Lisbon.ai - I got the participants to implement a collaborative filtering system in less than 4 hours (http://lisbon.ai/program.html#recommender) (here is the doc on the workshop - http://tiny.cc/kpa6mz)
- teaching `python for data science` to freshly hired consultants at Marionete (https://marionete.co.uk/) - a London based Data Engineering consultancy firm.
- teaching assistant at `LxMLS` (Lisbon Machine Learning Summer School - http://lxmls.it.pt/2019/LxMLS_guide_2019.pdf) for 2 years in a roll - mainly teaching first year PhD students
- teaching assistant in programming for `Algorithms: Design and Analysis` by Stanford and Tim Roughgarden on Coursera
