**tldr;** If you had only one question to judge the quality of the technical candidate for your startup, what would that question be?

> We have two numbers - 36 and 48. Write a function which receives as an input one of these numbers, and returns the other. **Important**: You are not allowed to use any of these - if clauses, loops and data structures. 

### If you had just one question


Here is what I needed to prepare ⬇️

- a shared `gitlab-runner` (between two repos on Gitlab)
- a cloud server (AWS EC2) on which `gitlab-runner` is working

⬆️


### Here are 3 example solutions

[1. Set-up Gitlab-Runner on a separate cloud machine](#gitlab-runner-cloud)

[2. Winning 1-min pitch for the General Audience](#gitlab-config)

[3. Avoid error `ENOSPC: no space left on device`](#enospc-error)
