üé® üíª It so happens that sometimes a startup does not have the cash to hire a designer to create their logo, but the startup still need to have a logo.

Here is what I suggest you do instead of waiting for months until the cash is available - make it yourselfüí°. It is true that it is not going to be amazing however you will have your logo now :). Let's dive in ‚¨áÔ∏è 


Tools:
1. [Canva](#canva)
2. [Convert](#convert)

## Canva <a name="canva"></a>

Design anything on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). You dcan create a **free** accounbt if you don't already have one. Choose to create a design with custom dimensions

The we make our design, and download it as a transparent PNG file. I will title *mine my_new_logo.png*. Voila - our new visual logo is ready.

## Convert <a name="convert"></a>


We now have our new logo but it is not in vector format - e.g. a SVG file. Let's make this happen.

Install [Imagemagic](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/convert.im6.1.html) on any Linux system - for Mac and Ubuntu, for example. ‚ùó This will not work on Windows. 

Navigate to the folder in which *mine my_new_logo.png* is and execute this command in the terminal:

```sh
convert mine my_new_logo.png mine my_new_logo.svg
```

It takes the transparent PNG file and converts it to a SVG file. Now we have our new logo in vector format which we can send to our investors, supporters, the media and any conferences we attend.
