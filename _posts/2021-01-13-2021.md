This is what I want from 2021

### Build a great team to work on a great cause

It is all about the peple who I meet and the people who I inspire.

I want us to be this highly effective agile unit. This means no clutter and no confusion. This means following a clear goal. This means persistent and yet well-paced pursue of perfection. We will never reach perfection. We will stop at `This is good, let's get this other thing done`. 

This means celebrating all efforts - successful or not, and being brave to tell when we have fallen. When we share our low points, someone comes close, offers a hand and helps us get back on our feet, ... or on our knees first before fully standing again.

We will make money, we will be happy and content and we will change the world.  

Come join us on this journey.
