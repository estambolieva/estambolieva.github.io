This is phenomenal, this is special, this is very personal. I am a huge fan of space, and having a second project supported by the European Space Agency's Business Incubator is beyond a dream come true. It is my new small personal piece of happiness. And I wanted to share it with you so you get energized by my joy and feel its warmth spearing around your face and ey

I feel extremely grateful to the team and jury who selected us to be a part of the program - especially after the first try did not go as planned. If you want to read about [how my previous company, which was also supported by ESA BIC PT imploded](https://katstam.com/how-i-walked_away-from-eur-152500/) - click the link :). I feel grateful to all the people who supported me through the last 3 years so I come back to this - this moment! Thank you.

> Good luck! For whatever you want to achieve!
