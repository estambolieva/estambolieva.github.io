Let's dive straight to it. It is very hard for every startup founder to craft our 1 sentence sales pitch. Luckily I learned how to do this from Helga, [read about her mentoring me here](https://katstam.com/b2b-sales-done-right/), and I will share it with you.

The structure of this 1 sentence goes like this:

> We help **INSERT GROUP HERE** do **INSERT WHAT YOU HELP WITH HERE**. I am more than happy to leave you with 2-3 ideas on how to do this for *YOUR ORGANIZATION*. 

Mega simple. The key ingredient here is how to fill in **INSERT GROUP HERE** and **INSERT WHAT YOU HELP WITH HERE** for maximum effect. Let's imagine that we are selling a platform to prevent bushfires to the head of civil protection of Wooroloo, Australia. 

Here is a bad example on how to do this.

⬇️⬇️⬇️

❌ We help **you** - **prevent bushfires in Woroloo**. I am more than happy to leave you with 2-3 ideas on how to do this for Wooroloo. 

⬆️⬆️⬆️

This example is bad because by saying **you** we do not build any credibility of having done this before with people holding similar positions at similar organizations. We also mention vaguely what we could do - but do not tie this with something measurable. 

Ans here is a great example on how to do this.

⬇️⬇️⬇️

✅ We help **heads of civil protection across Australia and California** - **reduce the risk of bushfires by NN%**. I am more than happy to leave you with 2-3 ideas on how to do this for Wooroloo.  

⬆️⬆️⬆️

This example is great because we show the head of civil protection at Woroloo that we have worked with people holding the same/similar positions at similar organizations (other civil protection agencies) with whom we have gotten actul results - NN% reduction in wildfire risk. 

### Key Takeaways

1. Make sure you explain to the person you are addressing (not the organization but the person - head of cilvi protection v.s. civil protection) that yo have worked with the same group of people beforehand.
2. Give them measurable outcomes of your value proposition.
3. Offer to help - with 2-3 ideas on how they can do this for their organization, for example.
